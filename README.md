- adding UI
- adding victory and defeat
- adding COs
- making a playable map
- adding sounds
- advanced AI
- adding more animations
- title screen, options, saving
- campaign / normal maps

## KNOWN BUGS
- ai units sometimes move to another unit's space (unknown cause)
- indirect units sometimes can attack after moving (unknown cause)
- can select empty target when attacking (unsure if solved)

## IDEAS

story: the human race was wiped of the face of the earth, now their creations wage war following their old orders. Some of them have manage to evolve, and are trying to overrun all other or create a peaceful society. (?) there's one surviving human, who has gone mad/creates humans to restore the human race/is the protag/is the main antagonist

possible mechanics:
- unit evolution
- unit merging makes a different unit or a more powerful version
- unit producing buildings give less funds?
- ability to redo missions

Units:
- Faster and more expensive infantry?
- Amphibian / flying infantry?

CO designs:
- units have more base hp (maybe for final CO)
- human / cyborg CO with special units?
- infantry CO with special unit / stronger bonuses from research ruins 
- vehicle CO with much more specialization
