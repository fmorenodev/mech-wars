TODO_LIST:
- building units DONE
- basic AI
- adding more units
- adding more terrain and making it functional
- adding UI
- adding victory and defeat
- adding COs
- advanced AI
- adding more animations
- title screen, options, saving
- campaign / normal maps
- fog (see how much time it takes)
notes for campaign:
- story: the human race was wiped of the face of the earth, now their creations wage war following their old orders. Some of them have manage to evolve, and are trying to overrun all other or create a peaceful society. (?) there's one surviving human, who has gone mad/creates humans to restore the human race/is the protag/is the main antagonist
- ability to redo missions

possible mechanics:
- unit evolution
- unit merging makes a different unit or a more powerful version
- unit producing buildings give less funds?

Units:
- Faster and more expensive infantry?
- Amphibian / flying infantry?

CO designs:
- units have more base hp (maybe for final CO)
- human / cyborg CO with special units?
- infantry CO with special unit / stronger bonuses from research ruins 
- vehicle CO with much more specialization
